        Inputs: 
            weight_landing - Landing weight of the aircraft [kilograms]
            number of engines - Number of engines installed on the aircraft [Dimensionless]
            thrust_sea_level - Sea Level Thrust of the Engine [Newtons]
            thrust_landing - Thrust of the aircraft coming in for landing [Newtons]
        
        Outputs:
            output() - Data Class
                takeoff - Noise of the aircraft at takeoff directly along the runway centerline  (500 ft altitude at 6500m from start of take-off) [dB]
                side_line - Noise of the aircraft at takeoff at the sideline measurement station (1,476 ft (450m) from centerline (effective distance = 1476*1.25 = 1845ft)[dB]
                landing - Noise of the aircraft at landing directly along the trajectory (370 ft altitude at 6562 ft (2000m) from runway) [dB]
            
        Assumptions:
        The baseline case used is 101 PNdb, 25,000 lb thrust, 1 engine, 1000ft
        The noise_increase_due_to_thrust and noise_landing are equation extracted from images. 
        This is only meant to give a rough estimate compared to a DC-10 aircraft. As the aircraft configuration varies from this configuration, the validity of the method will also degrade.
