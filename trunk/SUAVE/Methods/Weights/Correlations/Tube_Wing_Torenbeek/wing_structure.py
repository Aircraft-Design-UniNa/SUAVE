        Calculate the wing weight of the aircraft based on the fully-stressed 
        bending weight of the wing box        
        
        Inputs:
            S_gross_w - area of the wing [meters**2]
            b - span of the wing [meters**2]
            lambda_w - taper ratio of the wing [dimensionless]
            t_c_w - thickness-to-chord ratio of the wing [dimensionless]
            Nult - ultimate load factor of the aircraft [dimensionless]
            TakeoffWeight - maximum takeoff weight of the aircraft [kilograms]
            eng_wing - number of wing-attached engines [dimensionless]
            sweep_LE - leading edge sweep of the wing [radians]
            sweep_half - half-chord sweep of the wing [radians]
            V_D - Maximum Design Diving Speed [m/s]
            n_s - Distance of the strut mounting on a braced wing from a wing root divided by semi-chord span [dimensionless]
            W_Wing - Wing group weight [kilograms] 
            braced - Specifies in the wing is "braced" or "not braced"
            S_f - Area of the flaps [meters ** 2]
            b_f - Structural flap span of the wing [meters]
            V_stall - Stall speed of the aircraft in the landing configuration [meters/sec]
            d_f - Maximum angular deflection of the flaps  [radians]
            sweep_f - Average sweep angle of the flap structure
            t_c_f - Flap thickness-to-chord ratio in the streamwise direction
            flap_type - Denoting the flap type of the aircraft: "single-slotted, "double slotted, fixed hinge", "double slotted, 4-bar movement"\
                "single slotted Fowler", "double slotted Fowler", "triple slotted Fowler"
            variable_flap - Denoting whether there is variable geometry "yes" or no
            undercarriage - Denoting whether the undercarriage is "wing-mounted" or not mounted to the wing
            
        Outputs:
            output -
                wt_wing_structure - Weight of the main structure [kilograms]
                wt_wing_high_lift - Weight of the high lift structure [kilograms]
                wt_wing - weight of the wing including main structure, spoilers, and high lift structure[kilograms]
                
        Assumptions [Notes from Torenbeek]:
        This structural weight is derived from the requirement that the critical flight condition to be resisted is the bending moment due to wing lift.
        The weight of the high-lift devices is based on a critical loading condition at the flap design speed.
        Looking at subsonic short-haul aircraft, the original method underestimates wing weight since extra weight is required for adequate stiffness for wing \
            flutter and a weight penalty is necessary due to long service life requirements. A modification to incorporate high lift devices and spoilers was then added.
