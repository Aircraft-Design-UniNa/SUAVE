    """ roll_tau = SUAVE.Methods.Flight_Dynamics.Dynamic_Stablity.Approximations.roll(I_x, S_gross_w, density, velocity, span, Cl_p)
        Calculate the approximate time constant for the roll mode       
        
        Inputs:
            I_x -  moment of interia about the body x axis [kg * meters**2]
            S_gross_w - area of the wing [meters**2]
            density - flight density at condition being considered [kg/meters**3]
            span - wing span of the aircraft [meters]
            velocity - flight velocity at the condition being considered [meters/seconds]
            Cl_p - change in rolling moment due to the rolling velocity [dimensionless]
        
        Outputs:
            roll_tau - approximation of the time constant of the roll mode of an aircraft [seconds] (positive values are bad)
            
        Assumptions:
            Only the rolling moment equation is needed from the Lateral-Directional equations
            Sideslip and yaw angle are being neglected and thus set to be zero.
            delta_r = 0
            X-Z axis is plane of symmetry
            Constant mass of aircraft
            Origin of axis system at c.g. of aircraft
            Aircraft is a rigid body
            Earth is inertial reference frame
            Perturbations from equilibrium are small
            Flow is Quasisteady
