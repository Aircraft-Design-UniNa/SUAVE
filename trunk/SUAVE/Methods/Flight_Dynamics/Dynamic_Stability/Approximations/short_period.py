        Calculate the natural frequency and damping ratio for the approximate short period characteristics        
        
        Inputs:
            velocity - flight velocity at the condition being considered [meters/seconds]
            density - flight density at condition being considered [kg/meters**3]
            S_gross_w - area of the wing [meters**2]
            mac - mean aerodynamic chord of the wing [meters]
            Cm_q - coefficient for the change in pitching moment due to pitch rate [dimensionless]
            Cz_alpha - coefficient for the change in Z force due to the angle of attack [dimensionless]
            mass - mass of the aircraft [kilograms]
            Cm_alpha - coefficient for the change in pitching moment due to angle of attack [dimensionless]
            Iy - moment of interia about the body y axis [kg * meters**2]

            output - a data dictionary with fields:
                w_n - natural frequency of the short period mode [radian/second]
                zeta - damping ratio of the short period mode [dimensionless]
            
            
        Assumptions:
